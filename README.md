# DailyDosage
Daily Dosage is a medication tracking application.  The app enables people to keep track of the medications they are taking as well as a calender that plots out when to take each medication.  The application utilizes ASP.net Core, C#, Microsoft SQL.

The app allows the user to post photos of each medication and dosage information. By consolidating all the medications a person takes in one place, the app will make it easy to share medication information with doctors and/or hospital staff if the need arises.
